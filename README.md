Calculator Project

1. Build a basic calculator interface

   I have built a simple calculator interface with numbers, symbols and icons. Used a grid layout to space buttons and implemented a simple hover animation. By using SASS architecture it will be easier to maintain and manage the project as it develops.

2. Critical Analysis - Compare to to other interfaces

   Could do with additional mathematical operators such as percentage and negative numbers. Potential to add in more scientific functions and complex maths. Need to consider whether it is necesssary to apply truncation with floating point.

3. Apply changes to interface

   Applied responsive changes to the design to work on desktop and mobile devices.
   Working with ChatGPT to update the Javascript for the calculator with detailed comments to help me understand how the code is being applied. Testing the calculator there are several problems with the functionality of the calculator. Mainly with the % operator. Applying test cases, comparing to other calculators and explaining to ChatGPT how it should be expected to work.

4. Further critical anaylsis - Testing calculator functions

   Cannot add more than one decimal point per calculation. Percentage calculations including the minus operator are not working correctly. Numbers need to be limited to at least 2 decimal places. Need to update how the % function works with other operators.

5. Apply changes to functionality

   Implemented the toFixed() function to show output as floating point to 2 decimal places. Worked through multiple scenarios with ChatGPT to correct the logic of the percentage operator when working with all other operators.
