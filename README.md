Calculator Project

1. Build a basic calculator interface

   I have built a simple calculator interface with numbers, symbols and icons. Used a grid layout to space buttons and implemented a simple hover animation. By using SASS architecture it will be easier to maintain and manage the project as it develops.

2. Critical Analysis - Compare to to other interfaces

   Could do with additional mathematical operators such as percentage and negative numbers. Potential to add in more scientific buttons and complex maths. Need to consider how to apply truncation with floating point.

3. Apply changes to interface
